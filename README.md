# Lustre TIG
Telegraf Checks and Grafana Dashboards for Monitoring Lustre with TIG

### Note about community plugin
The Lustre community has already created a Lustre plugin for telegraf, named "Lustre2".  We leverage this plug in because it is great for getting us all the performance stats we need about Lustre file systems.  

This repo contains additional Lustre-related checks that verify system health, monitor aspects of the file system, as well as ingest quota information for tracking.
